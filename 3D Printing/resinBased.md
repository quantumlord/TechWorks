# Stereolithography (SLA)  
### Resin based, does not use filament or powder
Uses a beam of UV light to solidify the resin (Photopolymerization) 
- Pros: very smooth surface, used for visual models and is easy to paint
- Cons: some designs require support
### How to operate(upside-down SLA):      
1- Deisgn the part using CAD software.        

2-
